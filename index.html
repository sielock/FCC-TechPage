                    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach 
                        to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language 
                        for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. Unlike most languages, Python relies on whitespace to indicate scope
                        and omits the use of semicolons at the end of statements. 
                    <p>
                        Python also includes a massive number of standard and external libraries that can be leveraged in your projects. Some of the most common ones are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a> - used for scientific computing</li>
                        <li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> -  used for visualization</li>
                        <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">The Standard Library</a> - the libraries installed with Python by default.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Fun fact: Python was named after the British comedy group Monty Python, and the documentation features references to famous acts, such as the "Spam and Eggs" sketch.

                    <p>As you might expect, Pyton has a wide variety of applications. Here are some of the most common uses you might see:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web Development: Python has libraries such as Django, Flask and BeautifulSoup which make certain aspects of web development easy to setup and work with.</li>
                        <li>Scientific Applications: Numpy, Pandas and SciPy are just a few of the libraries that can be used in complex scientific and numeric computation.</li>
                        <li>Teaching Programming: Due to the simple, high-level syntax and data structures native to Python, it is a great language to introduce programming concepts to
                            people new to coding.

                <section>
                    <p>Python uses many similar data types as other languages, while including a few unique ones of its own. Some of the most common are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text Type:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>String <code>str</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Numeric Types:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Integer - <code>int</code></li>
                                <li>Floating Point - <code>float</code></li>
                                <li>Complex - <code>complex</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Sequence Types:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>List - <code>list</code></li>
                                <li>Tuple - <code>tuple</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Mapping Type:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dictionary - <code>dict</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Boolean Types:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>bool</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lists operate similarly to arrays in other languages, and Dictionaries are similar to associatve arrays in other languages (uses same key/value pair mapping).
                        There are other data types, such as sets and ranges, but these are less commonly seen especially for new learners.

                <header class="topic">Flow Control</header>
                <section>
                    <p>The most common forms of flow control you will encounter are if statements, for statements, and while statements.</p>
                    <h1>If Statement</h1>
                        <p>The <code>if</code> statement is used for conditional execution. It follows the if/else if pattern of other languages to evaluate multiple conditions. Python's
                            syntax differs in that it uses <code>elif</code> instead of <code>else</code>. This if/elif sequence is used in place of a <code>switch</code> statement,
                            as Python does not have the <code>switch</code> statment functionality other languages do.</p>
                        <code>
                            x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                            if x < 0:
                                x = 0
                                print('Negative changed to zero')
                            elif x == 0:
                                print('Zero')
                            elif x == 1:
                                print('Single')
                            else:
                                print('More')
                        </code>
                    <h1>For Statement</h1>
                        <p>The <code>for</code> statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object. Unlike most 
                        other languages, Python iterates over the items of any sequence in the order that they appear in the sequence. There is no need to set an iterator and halting condition:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
                            for w in words:
                                print(w)
                        </code>
                        <p>This code will iterate through the words list, and print out each value in the order that they appear.</p>
                    <h1>While Statement</h1>
                    <p>The <code>while</code> statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true:</p>
                    <code>
                        a = 0
                        while a < 10:
                            print(a)
                            a = a + 1
                    </code>
                    <p>This code will print the value of a, so long as the expression <code>a < 10</code> remains true. Once the expression returns false, then the code will stop running.
                        If there is an else clause present, the code within it will be executed upon the expression returning false.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>To write your first bits of Python code, you don't need an IDE. Python can be written and executed using the Python interpreter, which runs from the command line.
                        After installing the latest version of Python (at the time of writing, this is Python 3.9), open your Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Unix) and type: 
                        <br><code>python3.9</code>
                        This will start the interpreter in interactive mode. From here, type: 
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        def helloWorld():
                            helloString = "Hello World!"
                            print(helloString)
                    </code>
                        <p>Hit the Enter key twice and you have defined your first function! In order to see it work, type <code>helloWorld()</code> into the console and press enter!</p>
