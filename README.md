My code for the Technical Documentation Page project under the Responsive Web Design curriculum from freeCodeCamp.

The goal was to create a page that met these user story requirements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page

As the project recommends, I am building this in HTML, JavaSCript as needed, and I am attempting to impelent Bootstrap in addition to custom CSS. There are other projects in later curriculums that provide an opportunity to work with Bootstrap, but I thought I would give it a go with this project.

The site is being hosted on Github pages, and it can be seen live at: https://sielock.github.io/FCC-TechPage
