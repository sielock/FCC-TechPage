My code for the Technical Documentation Page project under the Responsive Web Design curriculum from freeCodeCamp.

The goal was to create a page that met these user story requirements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page

As the project recommends, I am building this in HTML and basic CSS, with minimal JavaScript as needed. Another project I am using to really work on my CSS fundamentals as it is the language introduced in this section (between HTML and CSS) that I feel is the most important to get a solid grasp of.

The site is being hosted on Github pages, and it can be seen live at: https://sielock.github.io/FCC-TechPage
